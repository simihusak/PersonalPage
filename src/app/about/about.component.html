                    I am software developer who is eager to learn and to develop more skills. I like to keep my
                    knowledge up
                    to
                    date with new technologies and find out better ways to solve a problem. My interests are mainly in
                    web
                    and
                    desktop development. In the past few years, I have been working on several projects where I worked
                    on
                    both
                    front end and back end. This allowed me to get insights into various programming languages and
                    frameworks.
